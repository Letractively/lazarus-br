Today while trying to install php-fpm to work with Apache in an Ubuntu server I’ve got this:

sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
The error was:

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Package libapache2-mod-fastcgi is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source

E: Package 'libapache2-mod-fastcgi' has no installation candidate
The problem was that multiverse repository was not enable in my apt sources, and there is where libapache2-mod-fastcgi is.

So I had to:

sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
And add these lines at the end:

deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal multiverse
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal multiverse
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal-updates multiverse
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal-updates multiverse
Change quantal, for the version of Ubuntu you are running. Then:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
